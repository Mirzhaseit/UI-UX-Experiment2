## Output:
### Designing a Basic Mobile and Web Layout for a Health App – Case Study (FreshBites)
#### FreshBites Logo Description

The FreshBites logo features a green circular badge, symbolizing freshness, health, and nature.

At the top inside the circle, small icons of fruits (banana, strawberry, grapes, pineapple, watermelon) are arranged in an arc, representing variety and nutrition.

The text “EAT FRESH” appears along the top curve, reinforcing the brand’s purpose.

At the center, the bold, white, serif text “FRESH BITES” gives the logo a clean, premium look.

At the bottom, the text “LIVE BETTER” follows the circular arc, promoting the idea of healthy living.

Small illustrations of sliced fruits at the bottom add visual balance and enhance the theme of freshness and organic food.

#### Applying Gestalt Principles to Enhance Design
#### Proximity

Food names, nutrition tags, star ratings, and prices are grouped together inside compact cards.

This grouping helps users quickly understand related information without cognitive overload.

#### Similarity

Buttons such as Order Now and Add to Cart follow the same structure and style.

Repeated use of similar icons (veg symbol, delivery icons) creates visual consistency across the app.

#### Continuity

Sections like Top Picks, Healthy Choices, and Quick Delivery are placed in horizontally scrollable carousels.

This supports a smooth left-to-right viewing flow and keeps users engaged.

#### Closure

Rounded containers and partial frames allow users to “complete” shapes in their minds.

The layout feels clean and organized even without full borders.

#### Figure/Ground

A blurred or contrasting background ensures that important elements (buttons, prices, titles) stand out clearly.

This directs attention toward actions the user needs to take.
